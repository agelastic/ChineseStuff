## Howell etymological dictionary

The .pdb file is my conversion of a dictionary previously piblished at kanjinetworks.com's (now defunct) to Pleco format. The original was by [Lawrence Howell](https://www.slideshare.net/KanjiNetworks "Slideshare") and I do not know what licence it comes under, assuming Creative Commons of some sort. Pdf's are included for reference, and are avaliable at his Slideshare. Whatever the scientific value of the dictionary (it is still disputed), I find it useful for thinking about mnenomics for remembering difficult characters. Character entries in the pdb file are traditional and do not have pinyin associated with them, thus they will only show up under "Chars/Other Pronunciations" tab in Pleco for 6500 traditional characters from the PDF.
